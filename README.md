* What is the average number of university students who should participate in this program
* What will be the average number of applications per week that we could have
* How many weeks should we extend the application process to select 60 students per commune?
* If we were to do all the bootcamp online, who would be the best communes and how many applications would we need to select 30 student and what percentage of students would have a laptop, an internet connection, both at the same time
